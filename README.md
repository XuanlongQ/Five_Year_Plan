# Five_Year_Plan

## Main Work
This work use computational approaches to relicate Xu and Heikkila's paper
- [How can cities learn from each other? Evidence from China's five-year plans](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585620300856)


## Datasets
1. the 12th Five Year Plan - 286 cities, you can get the dataset from [Here!]()

## Files
1. Doc2vec_model_training.py - Training Doc2vec model and get Doc2vec embeddings
2. Clustering.py - Using Doc2vec embeddings to conduct KMeans clustering

Note: Please remove the test.bin and all_docfiles.docx, which are placeholder Files.
